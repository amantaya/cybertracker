I created an external R script with contains all of the functions that I commongly use across different scripts. This chunk of code reads in those functions into the global R environment.
```{r}

First, let's read in the wolf database from September 12, 2020 at 08:15:00 am. This database contains mostly sighting records from J. Brad Miller, however there are some sightings from Manuel. Additionally, this database has a number of 'fake' data points that were created while learning the functionality of the Cybertracker application. We're going to be cleaning up the database in the following steps. In this database, sighting records from each user are mixed together, so we can't tell which records are from Manuel, and which are from J Brad Miller (yet). We will extract the sighting data recorded by each user into separate databases in a future step.
```{r}
wolf_data_RAW<- read.csv(file="C:/Users/andre/Dropbox/Horse_Research/Cybertracker/database_export/2020-09-12-08-15-00-wolf-xdiamond-database.csv", header=TRUE)

wolf_data_RAW
```
```{r}
wolf_tibble_RAW <- as_tibble(wolf_data_RAW)

wolf_tibble_RAW

# View(wolf_tibble_RAW)
```
```{r}
wolf_tibble_missing_locations_removed <- drop_na(wolf_tibble_RAW, Latitude)

wolf_tibble_missing_locations_removed

# View(wolf_tibble_missing_locations_removed)
```
Several records have erroneous wolf sighting data, which we need to inspect and determine if this data needs to be removed from the dataset. For example, two records have 99 adults and 22 adults, both numbers which are highly unlikely to occur in reality.
```{r}
filter(wolf_tibble_missing_locations_removed, Adults >= 10)
```
We're going to remove these erroneous data points by subsetting the dataframe. In this instance, we're selecting all sighting records that have fewer than 10 adults or the number of adults is NA (meaning that no wolves were sighted).
```{r}
wolf_tibble_too_many_adults_removed <-  subset(wolf_tibble_missing_locations_removed, Adults <= 10 | is.na(Adults))

wolf_tibble_too_many_adults_removed
```

Now let's clean up the dates, which will make visualizing our data much easier. This function uses the Lubridate package that has a special variable class just for working with dates. This function takes the Date and Time columns in our dataset and converts them to this special variable called 'DateTime'.

```{r}
cleandates <- function(df){
  df <- unite(df, Date, Time, col = "DateTime", sep = " ", remove = TRUE)
  df$DateTime <- mdy_hms(df$DateTime)
  df <- arrange(df, DateTime)
  return(df)
}
```


```{r}
wolf_tibble_dates_formatted <- cleandates(wolf_tibble_too_many_adults_removed)

wolf_tibble_dates_formatted
```
Let's take a look at all of the dates that users recorded sightings. This is helpful way to visualize the dataset to see what we're working with. Some of these dates have multiple sighting records, which is easily visualized in the plot.
```{r}
all_dates_table <- wolf_tibble_dates_formatted %>% group_by(date(DateTime)) %>% summarise(frequency = n())

all_dates_table

barplot(all_dates_table$frequency,
        axes = FALSE)
axis(1, at = seq(0.7, 27.1, by=1.2), labels = all_dates_table$`date(DateTime)`, las = 2, cex.axis = 0.75)
axis(2, at = seq(0, 10, by=1), cex.axis = .75, padj = 1)
```
```{r}
wolf_tibble_dates_formatted
```

```{r}
map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% addMarkers(lng = wolf_tibble_dates_formatted$Longitude, 
                                               lat = wolf_tibble_dates_formatted$Latitude, 
                                               popup = wolf_tibble_dates_formatted$Type)

map
```

```{r}
# Create a matrix to store the X (Longitude) and Y (Latitude) coordinates
coords = cbind(wolf_tibble_dates_formatted$Longitude, wolf_tibble_dates_formatted$Latitude) 
# View the first 6 rows of this newly created matrix
# head(coords)

# Define which Coordinate Reference System (CRS) we are using with this dataset
prj <- CRS("+init=epsg:4326")

# Create a Spatial Points Data Frame to store our data
wolf_spdf = SpatialPointsDataFrame(coords, 
                              wolf_tibble_dates_formatted, 
                              proj4string = prj)

# View the Spatial Points Data Frame
wolf_spdf
```
We need to remove the sighting records that were created at the X Diamond HQ. These records are likely 'fake' data that were created to learn and test the functionality of the Cybertracker application. First, we need to define the location of the X Diamond HQ.
```{r}
# These coordinates are the location of the X Diamond HQ
xdiamond_hq_coords <- data.frame(x = -109.42483722, y = 34.08112524)
xdiamond_hq_coords

# Convert the Data Frame into Spatial Points
# This uses the Coordinate Reference System defined in an earlier step
xdiamond_hq_coords_sp <- SpatialPoints(xdiamond_hq_coords, proj4string = prj)
xdiamond_hq_coords_sp
```
We need to transform the coordinates from lat/long into UTM, because UTM is a planar(grid) system and many of the actions we want to perform expects a planar system. Here we're going create multiple buffers to test if the buffer distance will select all of the records we want to remove from around the X Diamond HQ.
```{r}
# Transform from lat/long into UTM
# The units are in map units, which in this case is meters
xdiamond_hq_utm <- spTransform(xdiamond_hq_coords_sp, CRS("+init=epsg:32612"))

# Create a buffer around the X Diamond HQ
xdiamond_hq_20_buffer_utm <- gBuffer(xdiamond_hq_utm, width = 20)
xdiamond_hq_50_buffer_utm <- gBuffer(xdiamond_hq_utm, width = 50)
```
We also need to transform our wolf spatial points dataframe, from lat/long to UTM, for the same reason. 
```{r}
# Transform from lat/long into UTM
# The units are in map units, which in this case is meters
wolf_spdf_utm <- spTransform(wolf_spdf, CRS("+init=epsg:32612"))
wolf_spdf_utm  
```
Here we intersect the different buffer sizes with our wolf spatial points data frame. The last bit tests how many points intersected with each buffer to give us an idea of how the buffer sizes differ.
```{r}
xdiamond_hq_wolf_intersects_20 <- gIntersects(xdiamond_hq_20_buffer_utm, wolf_spdf_utm, byid=TRUE)

xdiamond_hq_wolf_intersects_50 <- gIntersects(xdiamond_hq_50_buffer_utm, wolf_spdf_utm, byid=TRUE)

# Count how many points intersected with each buffer
table(xdiamond_hq_wolf_intersects_20)["TRUE"]
table(xdiamond_hq_wolf_intersects_50)["TRUE"]
```
Now we're going to remove the points that intersected with the buffer, as these points represent the 'fake' data that was created at the X Diamond HQ as test data.
```{r}
wolf_spdf_fake_points_near_hq_removed <- wolf_spdf_utm[as.vector(xdiamond_hq_wolf_intersects_50) == FALSE, ]

# Display this new dataframe with the 'fake' points removed
as.data.frame(wolf_spdf_fake_points_near_hq_removed)

# Export as a Shapefile
# shapefile(wolf_spdf_fake_points_near_hq_removed, "wolf_cybertracker_database_cleaned.shp")
```
To better visualize which sighting records we removed, and how they affected our dataset, we're going to plot the data before we cleaned it up, and then after we cleaned it up. 
```{r}
wolf_tibble_cleaned <- as_tibble(wolf_spdf_fake_points_near_hq_removed)

cleaned_dates <- wolf_tibble_cleaned  %>% group_by(date(DateTime)) %>% summarise(frequency = n())

cleaned_dates

# Ideally, the x-axis should match when comparing the figures. However, I need to create a table of dates and frequencies, with 0s filled in for the dates where sighting records were removed during the cleaning process.

# This plot shows the number of sighting records by date BEFORE we cleaned up the database
barplot(all_dates_table$frequency, axes = FALSE, main = "Sighting Records Before Cleaning")
axis(1, at = seq(0.7, 27.1, by=1.2), labels = all_dates_table$`date(DateTime)`, las = 2, cex.axis = 0.75)
axis(2, at = seq(0, 10, by=1), cex.axis = .75, padj = 1)

# This plot shows the number of sighting records by date AFTER we cleaned up the database
barplot(cleaned_dates$frequency, axes = FALSE, main = "Sighting Records After Cleaning")
axis(1, at = seq(0.7, 21.1, by=1.2), labels = cleaned_dates$`date(DateTime)`, las = 2, cex.axis = 0.75)
axis(2, at = seq(0, 10, by=1), cex.axis = .75, padj = 1)
```
Let's plot the cleaned data on map to better visualize it.
```{r}
map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% addMarkers(lng = wolf_tibble_cleaned$Longitude, 
                                               lat = wolf_tibble_cleaned$Latitude, 
                                               popup = wolf_tibble_cleaned$Type)

map
```
We exported the Cybertracker database as two shapefiles, one with tracker points integrated into the the track, and another with just the sighting records. We already cleaned up the sighting records, so we don't need this shapefile. We do need the shapefile with the tracker points.
```{r}
ogrDrivers()

timer_tracks_spdf <- shapefile("C:/Users/andre/Dropbox/Horse_Research/Cybertracker/database_export/wolf_shapefile_integrated_track.SHP")

# The CRS is missing from the spatial points data frame (this is Cybertracker's fault)
# We'll set it to our standard WGS84
proj4string(timer_tracks_spdf) <- prj

# wolf_shapefile_spdf <- shapefile("C:/Users/andre/Dropbox/Horse_Research/Cybertracker/database_export/wolf_shapefile.SHP")

# proj4string(wolf_shapefile_spdf) <- prj

as.data.frame(timer_tracks_spdf)

wolf_tibble_cleaned
#View(as.data.frame(wolf_shapefile_spdf))
```
Let's clean up the tracker points spatial points data frame by removing a couple miscellaneous columns.
```{r}
timer_tracks_df <- as.data.frame(timer_tracks_spdf)

timer_tracks_df_misc_columns_removed <- timer_tracks_df[ , -c(1,2)]

as.data.frame(timer_tracks_df_misc_columns_removed)
```
We're also going to rename the columns to match our Wolf data.
```{r}
# To grab the column names fromt the Wolf data, we first have to undo combining the date and time columns
wolf_tibble_cleaned_dates_separated <- separate(wolf_tibble_cleaned, col = as.character("DateTime"), c("Date", "Time"), sep = " ")

column_names <- names(wolf_tibble_cleaned_dates_separated)

colnames(timer_tracks_df_misc_columns_removed) <- column_names

names(timer_tracks_df_misc_columns_removed)

timer_tracks_df_misc_columns_removed
```

And we'll convert the Date and Time to a new column DateTime using the Lubridate package.
```{r}
timer_tracks_combined_date_time_columns <- unite(timer_tracks_df_misc_columns_removed, Date, Time, col = "DateTime", sep = " ", remove = TRUE)

timer_tracks_combined_date_time_columns$DateTime <- ymd_hms(timer_tracks_combined_date_time_columns$DateTime)

timer_tracks_combined_date_time_columns
```
Let's drop all of the wolf sighting data from the timer track data to be sure we remove any 'fake' data. We'll replace that data with our cleaned up wolf sighting data. 
```{r}
timer_tracks_df_sightings_removed <- filter(timer_tracks_combined_date_time_columns, is.na(timer_tracks_combined_date_time_columns$Type) == TRUE)

View(timer_tracks_df_sightings_removed)
```

Now we need to transform the data into a planar CRS, in this case UTM.
```{r}
# We need to drop some extra columns that were created when we converted a Spatial Points Data Frame to regular data frame. We'll get these columns back when we convert into a new spdf. 

drops <- c("coords.x1", "coords.x2")

timer_tracks_dropped_extra_columns<- timer_tracks_df_sightings_removed[ , !(names(timer_tracks_df_sightings_removed) %in% drops)]

timer_tracks_coords <- cbind(timer_tracks_dropped_extra_columns$Longitude,
                             timer_tracks_dropped_extra_columns$Latitude)

timer_tracks_spdf <- SpatialPointsDataFrame(timer_tracks_coords, 
                                            timer_tracks_dropped_extra_columns, 
                                            proj4string = prj)

# Transform into UTM so we can do some planar operations
timer_tracks_utm <- spTransform(timer_tracks_spdf, CRS("+init=epsg:32612"))

as.data.frame(timer_tracks_spdf)
as.data.frame(timer_tracks_utm)
```
Similar to what we did to clean up the wolf sighting data, we're going to perform an intersect with the X Diamond HQ buffer to remove any tracker points that we're collected near the X Diamond HQ, such as when we tested collecting data at the HQ or when folks parked their trucks but forgot to turn off their units.
```{r}
xdiamond_hq_timer_tracks_intersects_50 <- gIntersects(xdiamond_hq_50_buffer_utm, timer_tracks_utm, byid=TRUE)

table(xdiamond_hq_wolf_intersects_50)["TRUE"]
```
